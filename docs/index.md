# The Kanji Study Tool
## Overview
The goal of this system is to improve Japanese student's retention of kanji they have learned. The system will do this
by gaining an understanding of how well the student know each kanji they have learned through quizzing sessions. Then in
following sessions the system will emphasize kanji determined to be known poorly by the student. These sessions will be a series
of questions that aim to improve how well the student recognizes learned kanji.
